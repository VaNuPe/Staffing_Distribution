# Staffing_Distribution
Strategically assigned key medical staff ahead of the flu season in the US using Excel, VLOOKUP, Python, and Tableau for data visualization.

## Context
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop severe complications and end up in the hospital. The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

## Key Questions
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

## Data
- Influenza deaths by geography. Source: [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov)

- Counts of influenza laboratory test results by state (survey). Source: [Fluview](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html)

## Results
All the preparation and the statistical analysis were conducted on Excel and consolidated in an [Interim Report](Influenza_Interim_Report.pdf), and drawing insights using data visualization techniques in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RecommendationsfortheInfluenzaSeasoninU_S_/StaffPlan?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
